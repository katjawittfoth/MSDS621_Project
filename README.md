# Classification model to predict genre from lyrics data
USF MSDS Machine Learning Group Project ðŸ¦„

Data: [380,000+ lyrics from MetroLyrics](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics)

This project aims to predict genre based on lyrics. We compared various supervised learning algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Linear Support Vector Classification), as well as explored the underlying structure of our data using k-means.
